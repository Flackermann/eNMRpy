eNMR basics
===========

eNMR is a unique NMR spectroscopic technique for the investigation of transport properties in electrolytes under the influence of an electric field. The electric field :math:`E` induces a coherent drift velocity :math:`\nu` of the investigated NMR-active nuclei, which is proportional to the electrophoretic mobility :math:`\mu` of the investigated species. 

.. math::
    \nu = \mu E

This coherent drift induces a phase shift :math:`\phi-\phi_0` of the observed NMR resonance, which is directly proportional to the observation time :math:`\varDelta`, the magnetic field gradient pulse duration :math:`\delta`, the magnetic field gradient pulse strength :math:`G`, and the gyromagnetic ratio of the observed nucleus :math:`\gamma`.


.. math::

   \phi - \phi_0 = \gamma G \delta \varDelta \nu\\

eNMR combines the spectroscopic selectivity with electrochemistry, enabling the `determination of electrochemical transference numbers <https://pubs.rsc.org/en/content/articlelanding/cp/2018/c7cp08580j#!divAbstract>`_ of a plethora of ionic species, which would otherwise not be possible. The determined transference numbers are sign sensitive contrary to transference number estimations from the self-Diffusion coefficient via the Nernst-Einstein equation.
Furthermore, using eNMR, the correlated migration of uncharged molecules with ions can be observed observing the migration of e.g. `complex lithium-oligoether cations <https://pubs.acs.org/doi/abs/10.1021/acs.jpcb.9b11330>`_, or the `interaction of additives/co-solvents with ions <https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/full/10.1002/mrc.4978>`_ in highly concentrated ionic systems.
