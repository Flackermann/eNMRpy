Version 0.0.2

- code cleanup removing unnecessary wrapper functions which clutter the code
    - eNMRpy.eNMR_Methods.plot_spec_comparison_to_0() removed since its a trivial plotting function
    - eNMRpy.eNMR_Methods.analyzePhasecorretion()-wrapper removed!
        - this should be done individually and is seldomly practical

- autophase() changed to autophase_phase_analysis()

- eNMRpy.Phasefitting.peakpicker() added, which returns a eNMR.Phasefitting.make_model()-compatible array with picked peaks

- eNMRpy.Phasefitting.SpecModel.set_mathematical_constraints()
    - reset function was extended to the vary option solving a previously unintended behavior
    - reset without array (expr=None) fixed
    
- a number of docstrings and comments were added

- eNMRpy.Phasefitting.plot_correlations() changed to eNMRpy.Phasefitting.plot_correlations_heatmap()

- eNMRpy.Phasefitting.SpecModel.plot_init_spec() the single_peaks default was set to False

- eNMRpy.Phasefitting.SpecModel.get_phasedata() changed to .get_result_values(), as it is a more accurate description of the method


Version 0.0.1
- The subpkg Measurement was added to the build to make it functional


Version 0.0.0
- SpecModel.set_mathematical_constraints() now resets all mathematical constraints before new assignment, which can be deactivated by setting reset=False
